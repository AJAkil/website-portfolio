                    Apart from academic activities, I like to keep my life as diverse as possible. I enjoy travelling and so far I have visited about 
                    5 countries. I enjoy a good book time to time and I like to dive deep into things that I find fascinating, ranging from nordic mythology to
                    the roots and connections of various tonal languages.

                                of Bangla Natural Language Processing namely: Paraphrasing and Readable Text Simplification. We successfully curated a synthetic paraphrase dataset ensuring both diversity and semantics by designing a novel dataset filtering pipeline, two of the
                                most important criteria for a high-quality paraphrase, and developed a transformer-based paraphrase
                                generating model and presented rigorous analysis with existing Bangla Paraphrase datasets.

                                of our thesis, we are attempting to simplify complex Bangla texts. As of now, The results look promising and we have identified the potential bottlenecks of the pipeline. We hope to ameliorate
                                the performance upon further experimentations.</p>

                            <p> Objective of this research project is to classify mutated variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from their primary protein sequences with the help of language models.
                                We generated full protein sequence embeddings using pretrained proT5 model. The embeddings have been used to train a varient classifier. 
                                Currently we are leveraging existing mutation generating models to generate mutations for the varients of spike protein sequences which will be used to test the robustness of the trained classifier. 
                                We also plan to incorporate other forms of mutation generation as well as present interpretibility of our proposed models.

                            <p> We developed an integrated dashboard as a one-stop decision support system for the covid-19 pandemic. We performed several predictions (next day predictions, when would we keep corona under control, country-wise affected and dead, etc) using customised epidemiology models. 
                                These analyses were demonstrated through interactive charts, graphs, and maps. We also explored the correlations between disease spread and diverse socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, we presented how the outcomes of our work
                                can facilitate both contemporary and future policy-making. My personally contribution to the project was by working on the Back-End part of the dashboard, integrating database and API endpoints, and ensuring security as well as optimization.

                        <p> Worked extensively on enterprise AI project with real world data that tackles important business needs. I worked mainly with speech and image
                            data modalities. For the speech project, worked to develop a sound event detection system leveraging pretrained models and 
                            contributed to different parts of the pipeline(noise removal techniques exploration, data processing etc). I Also worked on 
                            various Image processing-based projects where I was a part of teams to develop custom ID card detector, facial recognition detector
                            as well as financial statement parsing by leveraging exisiting deep learning models and customising according to business needs. I learned to
                            develop pre and post processing of real world image data and came to know the challenges and limitations first hand and also picked up some basic
                            skills about ML in production, it's pipeline and challenges. In the Last
                            days of my internships, I worked with the famous ELK stack to develop custom visualization for internal usage of the company.
